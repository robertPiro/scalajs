<head><title>ScalaJS with Scalatra</title></head>
<H1>Landing Page</H1>
There are two pages you can go to in this miniscule project:
<ul>
    <li>A <a href="/firstTinyJS">page</a> with a tiny JS application printing on the console</li>
    <li>A testing <a href="/caveats">page</a>, making sure one can retrieve content in the <code>/webapp</code> dir. </li>
</ul>
<p>To run the JS applicaton, one just calls <code>compileAll</code> on the <code>sbt</code> command line.
This should, in all theory, place the output files, <code>scala-js-tutorial-fastopt.js</code> and
<code>scala-js-tutorial-fastopt.js.map</code> in the <code>/assets/js</code> folder whence it can be 
retrieved by the first page with the tiny JS application. Admittedly, the JS page looks a bit worse for 
wear but it does the job as advertised.

For the second page, nothing needs to be done.
